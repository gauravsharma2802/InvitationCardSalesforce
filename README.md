# InvitationCardSalesforce


This project is focused on creating an invitation card within a Salesforce Experience Site. The application leverages Lightning Web Components (LWC) for the front-end interface and Apex Classes for server-side logic. Apex Classes are used to retrieve data from Salesforce and display it dynamically within the LWC component.

Key Features:
Lightning Web Components (LWC): Custom components built using LWC to display the invitation card.
Apex Classes: Server-side logic to fetch and process data from Salesforce.
Experience Site Integration: Hosted as part of a Salesforce Experience Site, allowing for external user access.
The application provides a seamless user experience by integrating Salesforce data within an aesthetically designed invitation card.

The project is publicly accessible, and anyone can view the invitation card through the following link:
